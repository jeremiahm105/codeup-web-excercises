Forms Notes
//different button types allow you to reset the page
//if a form is designed to go to another page its not a button its a ahref link
//be consisitent with using the attributes in input and labels
//every input needs a name and a type minimum
//basic get method is searching in google.Post will always be used for logins
//inside textarea can use maxleght to control the characters
\\always wrap your forms in labels to decorate and manipulate which cannot be done with input
//if we wrap in label we dont need a for attribute if we dont we need a for attribute so thats why wrapping is better otherwise we would have to ise an id attribute
//if using multiple choice just use checkbox if only accepting one answer use radio
if using the checked for radio and checkbox or selected for dropdown menu place in input after value
also placing the

in the select drop menu you can use the attribute required to ensure a option is selected and make the empty space a empthy string in order to make an valid option
the required ensure the form is filled out completely before submitting
the hidden attribute is useful for the backend not the user can also be used for security or referral links
when using the h element the size represents the level of importance on the page

CSS
styel sheets use link element a void element with 2 attributes:rel and href ref="stylesheet, and href is folder path
can have multiple css style in a page
when designing inline takes precedence over external style sheets
style sheets go in the head becasue we want the style to load first on the page to display correctly
both style sheets and inline style can be used at same time both in the heading
using the style attrubute  is the easiest way to add a style but also most recommended

Selector
three types element ID and Class
Id selectors preceded by symbol (#)
class selectors preceded by period (.)
//class selectors take precedence over element selectors whcih ever rule is more specific will take precedence and which rule came last
when adding multiple classes in a html from css style include both in parenthesis with just a space in between.

in css file multiple selectors can be on same line seperated by comma
//class selectorson the same line have no space or anything between
//descendent selectors
type parent selector a space then the descendent
//direct child selector similar to descendent except changes are only applied to che child only it uses a > symbol instead of empty space
//combining selectors
combine selectors with no spacing
pseudo class used to specify a specific style only to a particular state of an element uses symbol : after element
//pseudo elements are most commonly used with anchor elements such as a link and what the mouse does when you click or hover

class selectors no space
descendent is one space
direct child is >
combine selectors no space
//Colors
use the rbg value red blue and greem and represent hex colors starting with #FFFFFF which is white can be shortened to 3 letters and is the value of the color property

font sizes Therefore, avoid using pixels for font sizes if you wish to create an inclusive design.

inherting styles allowed on every css property

CSS Box Model
padding number go top, right bottom left

margin does not stack with other margins of different elements it just takes the bigger margin
to center something use margin 0, auto interview question how to push it any where use auto only works left and right
oveerall box size does not include margin

<div> does nothing it just groups relative elements together

<span>
Explanation of the rules:

//display: block;: This rule changes the display property of images to block, which means they will take up the entire width available and create a new line below the preceding content.

//max-width: 100%;: This rule ensures that the maximum width of the image will be 100% of its containing parent's width. This prevents images from exceeding the width of their container.
height: auto;: This rule maintains the aspect ratio of the images by automatically adjusting the height while respecting the specified max-width property.

//Just make sure that this CSS code is included after any CSS reset you might be using and before your other styles to ensure it takes precedence.

//height: auto;: This rule maintains the aspect ratio of the images by automatically adjusting the height while respecting the specified max-width property.

Flex Model
allows you to create complex layouts
built on parent child relationship
When the parent element is given the display: flex property, it becomes a flexbox container. It then has access to additional flex properties that allow it to control the layout of its children.


By default, flexbox containers organize their children horizontally. This is called the "row" direction. You can change this behavior by setting the flex-direction property to column

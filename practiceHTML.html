Forms Notes
//different button types allow you to reset the page
//if a form is designed to go to another page its not a button its a ahref link
//be consisitent with using the attributes in input and labels
//every input needs a name and a type minimum
//basic get method is searching in google.Post will always be used for logins
//inside textarea can use maxleght to control the characters
\\always wrap your forms in labels to decorate and manipulate which cannot be done with input
//if we wrap in label we dont need a for attribute if we dont we need a for attribute so thats why wrapping is better otherwise we would have to ise an id attribute
//if using multiple choice just use checkbox if only accepting one answer use radio
if using the checked for radio and checkbox or selected for dropdown menu place in input after value
also placing the

in the select drop menu you can use the attribute required to ensure a option is selected and make the empty space a empthy string in order to make an valid option
the required ensure the form is filled out completely before submitting
the hidden attribute is useful for the backend not the user can also be used for security or referral links
